# CriticalEventManagementHub: Centralized Event Management for Critical Infrastructure
A robust, Python-based framework for real-time event monitoring, analysis, and response for critical infrastructure systems.

The CriticalEventManagementHub (CEMH) is a cutting-edge platform designed to provide a centralized event management system for critical infrastructure organizations. The platform enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and response to events that could potentially disrupt operations or compromise security. By leveraging advanced data analytics, machine learning, and automation capabilities, CEMH empowers organizations to proactively identify and mitigate threats, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.

The CEMH platform is built to address the unique challenges faced by critical infrastructure organizations, including the need for real-time situational awareness, accurate event detection, and rapid response capabilities. By providing a unified view of events across multiple systems and teams, CEMH facilitates collaboration, streamlines incident response, and optimizes resource allocation.

Some of the key benefits of using CEMH include:

* Improved event detection accuracy through machine learning-based anomaly detection
* Enhanced situational awareness through real-time event visualization and analytics
* Faster incident response times through automated workflows and notifications
* Improved collaboration and communication across teams and stakeholders
* Scalability and flexibility to accommodate diverse infrastructure and system requirements

## Key Features

* Real-time event ingestion and processing from multiple data sources
* Advanced event analytics and machine learning-based anomaly detection
* Configurable event thresholds and alerting rules
* Customizable dashboards and visualization tools for real-time situational awareness
* Automated incident response workflows and notification systems
* Integration with existing infrastructure and systems through APIs and SDKs

## Technology Stack

* Python 3.9 as the primary programming language
* Flask as the web application framework
* PostgreSQL as the primary database management system
* Apache Kafka for event streaming and messaging
* Apache Cassandra for distributed data storage
* Machine learning libraries including scikit-learn and TensorFlow
* Frontend built using React and Redux

## Installation

To install CEMH, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/CriticalEventManagementHub.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the database: `python setup.py db_create`
4. Start the application: `python app.py`
5. Access the application: `http://localhost:5000`

## Configuration

CEMH uses environment variables for configuration. The following variables must be set:

* `CEMH_DB_URL`: The URL of the PostgreSQL database
